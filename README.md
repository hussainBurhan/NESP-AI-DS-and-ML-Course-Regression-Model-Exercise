# Boston Housing Price Prediction

## Overview

This project uses a RandomForestRegressor model to predict housing prices in Boston based on various features. The dataset used is provided in the `boston.csv` file.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to train a RandomForestRegressor model for regression tasks.
- Learn how to evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Practice data preprocessing and splitting techniques.

## Files

- `boston.csv`: The dataset containing the features and target variable for the housing prices.
- `prediction_script.py`: The Python script for training the model and making predictions.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas) installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run the `main.py` file to train the model and make predictions.

## Dependencies

- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas

## Output

After running the `prediction_script.py`, you will see the predicted MEDV values and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the console output:
predicted MEDV: [24.03 30.53 16.79 ...]
means absolute error: 2.14
